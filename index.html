  <p>Over 100 million people are homeless in the world. About 582,000 People in America with 30% coming from
    California. There is an increasing gap between housing costs and income. In the 1970s many communities had
    affordable housing. Since the mid 1980s rents have continued to rise while wages have had stagnant growth. </p>

    <p class="TitleP revealable">ADDICTION</p>
    <p>The most common stereotype of chronically homeless people is that they are drug and alcohol addicts. 68% of U.S.
      cities report that addiction is a their single largest cause of homelessness. A formerly homeless addict is likely
      to return to homelessness unless they deal with the addiction. Treatment programs are needed that treat the root
      causes of addiction and help men and women find a way back home.</p>

    <p class="TitleP revealable">FORECLOSURE</p>
    <p> People who have jobs are finding themselves upside down with their mortgages. From 2008 to 2009, foreclosures
      jumped by 32%. A 2009 survey estimates that as many as 10% of people seeking help from homeless organizations do
      so due to foreclosure.</p>

    <p class="TitleP revealable">JOBLOSS & UNDEREMPLOYMENT</p>
    <p>The current downtown in the economy has many Americans barely getting by financially. Many are underemployed at
      wages that can’t sustain them. Layoffs and job cuts leave individuals and families in desperate circumstances.
      Unemployment benefits and savings run out, leaving people homeless who never thought it could happen to them.</p>

        <p>This crisis is a moral and economic issue that requires immediate action. We call on policymakers to increase

          to call home. Your signature can help drive change and provide hope to those in need.</p>
